This package provides functionality for manipulating @FilePath@ values, and is shipped with both <https://www.haskell.org/ghc/ GHC> and the <https://www.haskell.org/platform/ Haskell Platform>. It provides three modules:

* "System.FilePath.Posix" manipulates POSIX\/Linux style @FilePath@ values (with @\/@ as the path separator).

* "System.FilePath.Windows" manipulates Windows style @FilePath@ values (with either @\\@ or @\/@ as the path separator, and deals with drives).

* "System.FilePath" is an alias for the module appropriate to your platform.

All three modules provide the same API, and the same documentation (calling out differences in the different variants).
